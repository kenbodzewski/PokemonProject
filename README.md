# PokemonProject
This is the repository for Ken Bodzewski's Final Project for CS5610 (Web Development) Fall 2022, Northeastern University, The Roux Institute

To run this project :
1. clone this repository and pull to make sure you have all contents
2. cd into 'client' directory and run command 'npm install'
3. cd into 'backend' directory and run command 'npm install'
4. set up .env files as directed in email
5. now you will need to have two terminals open 
6. in the first terminal cd to 'backend' directory and run command 'npm start' (important to run the backend first)
7. in the second terminal cd to 'client' directory and run command 'npm start' (only run client once backed in successfully running)

The project should now be running, and the website should automatically open in your browser. The website can take a little while to get started.
If the project did not open in your browser even after the frontend and backend are running successfully, then you can open a new browser window and navigate to: localhost:3000

NOTE TO TA's: 
1. If you run into any issues trying to run the application please email me at ken.bodzewski@gmail.com. I will have my phone with me all weekend and I get push notifications for this email but not my school email.
