# PokemonProject
This is the repository for Ken Bodzewski's Final Project for CS5610 (Web Development) Fall 2022, Northeastern University, The Roux Institute

To run this project :
1. pull everything from this repository
2. cd into 'client' directory and run command 'npm install'
3. cd into 'backend' directory and run command 'npm install'
4. now you will need to have two terminals open
5. in the first terminal cd to 'client' directory and run command 'npm start'
6. in the second terminal cd to 'backend' directory and run command 'npm start'

The project should now be running, and the website should automatically open in your browser. The website can take a little while to get started.
If the project did not open in your browser even after the frontend and backend are running, then you can open a new browser window and navigate to: localhost:3000
